# Detection of bullying in text surveys using Machine Learning

This is a degree project done in the spring of 2024 at <em>Linnaeus university</em> in collaboration with <em>Tietoevry</em> and the <em>Friends Foundation</em>. 

The project explores various supervised machine learning algorithms as well as locally run LLMs with RAG to evaluate how they perform in the task of detecting bullying in textual data. The data is from real school surveys provided by the Friends Foundation. 
 
### Supervised machine learning algorithms and LLMs evaluated: 
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Llama 3 (8B) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **GPT-4o** <em>(Only one not run locally)</em>


### The project also dives into different NLP techniques:
- **Text Preprocessing:** <em>Tokenization, Stop words removal, Stemming and lemmatization</em>
- **Feature Extraction:** <em>Bag of Word, TF-IDF</em>
- **Word embeddings:** <em>pre-trained swedish embedding from FastText</em>
